## Configuration

### Docker Compose

In order to run the project using Docker Compose on Visual Studio you must set the docker-compose project as a start up project and add a local file to the root directory of the project **docker-compose.override.yml** as follows:

#### Docker Compose Override

```
services:
  product.api:
    volumes:
      - ${APPDATA}/ASP.NET/Https:/root/.aspnet/https:ro

```

Make sure the Docker Compose project is set as the default startup project. Right-click on the docker-compose node in the Project Explorer, and select the _Set as StartUp Project_ menu option:

![Set Docker Compose as StartUp Project](docs/media/vs-startup-project.png)

Now you can build and run the application by pressing the Debug button in the toolbar:

After the Docker container has spun up in Docker desktop, it will be displayed as follows:

Then, you can access test the project endpoints using the Swagger UI via https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html
